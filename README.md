# RMAP

The Rotating Motion Activated Pedestal

Based on [this Arduino project](https://create.arduino.cc/projecthub/lindsi8784/motion-following-motorized-camera-base-61afeb).

## Parts

### Arduino Uno

Controls the servo motor based on input from the PIR sensors.

### TowerPro MG996R Servo

Moves the top of the pedestal to different positions. The [TowerPro MG996R 360째 Servo](https://www.amazon.com/Tower-MG996R-Rotation-Robotic-Servo/dp/B081XC2BM4) I got did not work like a regular servo, but the [180째 version](https://www.amazon.com/4-Pack-MG996R-Torque-Digital-Helicopter/dp/B07MFK266B) works fine.

### PIR Sensors

The motion sensors direct the servo to move to look toward the motion. [These PIR sensors](https://www.amazon.com/HC-SR501-Sensor-Infrared-Arduino-Raspberry/dp/B07KBWVJMP) worked fine, but they do have a one minute initialization time, so keep that in mind.

## Concept

The RMAP is a circular pedestal with 5 sensors at regular angles over a 180째 arc. A servo in the center rotates a flat, circular top between 0 and 180째 to point anything on top of it in the direction of the detected motion. The idea is to create a base that rotates to follow motion. With a camera or phone positioned on top, it would function similarly to the [Facebook Portal](https://www.amazon.com/Portal-Facebook-Hands-Free-Calling-Built/dp/B07HFWG8S4).
